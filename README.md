# lk3rd - A (3rd stage?!) bootloader for Exynos 990 devices.
And it gets even better...

## NOTICE
This bootloader is no longer actively being developed as Igor and I (halal-beef) no longer have devices nor the motivation to develop this further.

## INFO
I dont have experience doing this, so expect minimal updates from me (objectfigure) , i only own one device so one or two may fall through the cracks

## What?!
It's a lot of things.
* a bootloader (duh?)
* a hardware testing playground
* a fastboot interface
* a learning experience :)

## Let me install it!
Sure, check the release tab and follow the instructions. Be careful when using the bootloader though, we are not responsible for your actions when you use the bootloader, if you brick cause of it, it is not our fault.

## What devices does it run on?
* the canvas family
* the hubble family
* r8s, has no family

## What is this commit history?!
We based lk3rd off of Linaro's source code for their Exynos 850 board, which contained code for Exynos 990 as well. Thus, the commit history is a mix of Linaro/Samsung/upstream.

## What works?
Booting, display (with DECON), UFS and USB. Regulators seem to initialize, and the device is charging.

## Boot Sequence
You may be wondering, how the hell are you booting this? We can't replace our bootloaders!
Well, you're right, but we dont replace our bootloaders ;).
This flowchart of what happens will show you how we actually boot lk3rd.

    C --> D["Boot from boot partition, which has had a boot image with a payload as kernel (lk3rd)"]
    D --> E["lk3rd relocates itself, sets up Peripherals, DECON, USB and UFS, but doesn't use the display, instead using the framebuffer"]
    E --> F["Framebuffer is cleared once again, logs and then the fastboot text appears, when fastboot is launched, ready to take commands from the user"]

## TODO

- [x] Get UFS Fully up
- [x] Position independent code
- [x] Booting Android
- [x] Implement fastboot boot

Cheers from the Exynos990-Mainline team!
